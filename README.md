# svd-vs-autoencoder
## Comparison of dimensionality reduction results of SVD vs Autoencoder
This code is a technical part of the "Matrix factorizations application in text analysis" project.

The main aim was to compare results of dimensionaity reduction using SVD and Autoencoder. 
Results were compared by building classification model on the compressed data and evaluating it.
